# peek-a-tab
**Quick and effortless tabs management for chrome**

Gmail(1) + drive(1) + docs(2) + spreadsheet(2) + facebook(2) + news(6) + whatsapp web(1) + youtube(2) + amazon(2) + some cool thing I found recently (5) + some old stuff I want to read but haven't till now and it is there for past 5 days(3) + stack overflow (5) + google search for those stack overflow questions (2)= 34 tabs right now in my browser window

34 tabs!!, and I can't find where's the one I want right now, and it's eating the memory too.

And I don't think it's the problem just I have, almost everybody I have seen surfing internet has this problem. So, here's the solution.

Things it can do:
* Get a quick preview of each tab as you move your mouse on the list
* close the one you want 
* or just change to the one by clicking on the list item

Wish list:
* better UI/UX
* drag-drop list items to change tabs' positions
* tab suspension from the list itself
